# Do not alter lines that begin with ##, they are used when upgrading

#
# This file configures authdaemond, the resident authentication daemon.
#
# Comments in this file are ignored.  Although this file is intended to
# be sourced as a shell script, authdaemond parses it manually, so
# the acceptable syntax is a bit limited.  Multiline variable contents,
# with the \ continuation character, are not allowed.  Everything must
# fit on one line.  Do not use any additional whitespace for indentation,
# or anything else.

##NAME: authmodulelist:2
#
# The authentication modules that are linked into authdaemond.  The
# default list is installed.  You may selectively disable modules simply
# by removing them from the following list.  The available modules you
# can use are: authuserdb authvchkpw authpam authldap authmysql authpgsql

authmodulelist="authuserdb authvchkpw authpam authmysql"

##NAME: authmodulelistorig:3
#
# This setting is used by Courier's webadmin module, and should be left
# alone

authmodulelistorig="authuserdb authvchkpw authpam authmysql"

##NAME: daemons:0
#
# The number of daemon processes that are started.  authdaemon is typically
# installed where authentication modules are relatively expensive: such
# as authldap, or authmysql, so it's better to have a number of them running.
# PLEASE NOTE:  Some platforms may experience a problem if there's more than
# one daemon.  Specifically, SystemV derived platforms that use TLI with
# socket emulation.  I'm suspicious of TLI's ability to handle multiple
# processes accepting connections on the same filesystem domain socket.
#
# You may need to increase daemons if as your system load increases.  Symptoms
# include sporadic authentication failures.  If you start getting
# authentication failures, increase daemons.  However, the default of 5
# SHOULD be sufficient.  Bumping up daemon count is only a short-term
# solution.  The permanent solution is to add more resources: RAM, faster
# disks, faster CPUs...

daemons=5

##NAME: authdaemonvar:2
#
# authdaemonvar is here, but is not used directly by authdaemond.  It's
# used by various configuration and build scripts, so don't touch it!

authdaemonvar=/var/run/authdaemond

##NAME: subsystem:0
#
# The syslog facility uses subsystem to determine which log messages
# are recorded in which log files.
#
# The currently defined subsystems are:
#
#	o auth
#	o authpriv
#	o console
#	o cron
#	o daemon
#	o ftp
#	o kern
#	o lpr
#	o mail
#	o news
#	o security
#	o user
#	o uucp
#	o local0
#	o local1
#	o local2
#	o local3
#	o local4
#	o local5
#	o local6
#	o local7
#
# Note:  Not all of the above facility names are implemented on
# every system.  Check your system's syslog documentation for
# information on which facility names are allowed, and which log
# files record the corresponding messages for each facility.

subsystem=mail

##NAME: DEBUG_LOGIN:0
#
# Dump additional diagnostics to syslog
#
# DEBUG_LOGIN=0   - turn off debugging
# DEBUG_LOGIN=1   - turn on debugging
# DEBUG_LOGIN=2   - turn on debugging + log passwords too
#
# ** YES ** - DEBUG_LOGIN=2 places passwords into syslog.
#
# Note that most information is sent to syslog at level 'debug', so
# you may need to modify your /etc/syslog.conf to be able to see it.

DEBUG_LOGIN=0

##NAME: DEFAULTOPTIONS:0
#
# A comma-separated list of option=value pairs. Each option is applied
# to an account if the account does not have its own specific value for
# that option. So for example, you can set
#   DEFAULTOPTIONS="disablewebmail=1,disableimap=1"
# and then enable webmail and/or imap on individual accounts by setting
# disablewebmail=0 and/or disableimap=0 on the account.

DEFAULTOPTIONS="wbnodsn=1"

##NAME: LOGGEROPTS:0
#
# courierlogger(1) options, e.g. to set syslog facility
#

LOGGEROPTS=""

##NAME: LDAP_TLS_OPTIONS:0
#
# Options documented in ldap.conf(5) can be set here, prefixed with 'LDAP'.
# Examples:
#
#LDAPTLS_CACERT=/path/to/cacert.pem
#LDAPTLS_REQCERT=demand
#LDAPTLS_CERT=/path/to/clientcert.pem
#LDAPTLS_KEY=/path/to/clientkey.pem
